# Car Price Prediction Model using Machine Learning
## 1. Introduction
The Car Price Prediction Model aims to predict the price of cars based on various features such as make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, engine capacity, and other relevant factors. Machine learning techniques are employed to analyze historical car data and develop a predictive model to estimate the selling price of cars accurately.

## 2. Problem Statement
The goal is to build a robust machine learning model that can predict car prices with high accuracy. This model will assist both buyers and sellers in determining fair market prices for cars, thereby facilitating informed decision-making and optimizing transactions in the automotive market.

## 3. Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of historical data on various car listings, including features such as:
Make

Model

Year

Mileage

Engine Capacity

Fuel Type

Transmission Type

Body Type

Price (target variable)

## 4. Methodology
